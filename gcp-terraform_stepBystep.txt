# Prerequisites
To run the commands described in this document, you need to have the following installed:

The Google Cloud SDK version 319.0.0 or later
Terraform version 0.13.7.
An existing project which the user has access to be used by terraform-validator.
Note: Make sure that you use the same version of Terraform throughout this series. Otherwise, you might experience Terraform state snapshot lock errors.

# Set up the environment
Also make sure that you've done the following:

Set up a Google Cloud organization.
Set up a Google Cloud billing account.
Created Cloud Identity or Google Workspace groups for organization and billing admins.

Added the user who will use Terraform to the group_org_admins group. They must be in this group, or they won't have roles/resourcemanager.projectCreator access.

For the user who will run the procedures in this document, granted the following roles:
The roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin role on the Google Cloud organization.
The roles/billing.admin role on the billing account.
The roles/resourcemanager.folderCreator role.

## Create the Terraform service account for The Project
Grant the service account permission to view the Admin Project and manage Cloud Storage
Grant roles/billing.admin role on the billing account.
Grant roles/resourcemanager.folderCreator role.

Terraform requires the following API's be enabled run, 

gcloud services enable cloudresourcemanager.googleapis.com
gcloud services enable cloudbilling.googleapis.com
gcloud services enable iam.googleapis.com
gcloud services enable compute.googleapis.com
gcloud services enable serviceusage.googleapis.com

## Service Account Authenticating the SDK to Google Cloud:
gcloud auth activate-service-account terraform-50982-host@sixth-backbone-341422.iam.gserviceaccount.com --key-file=C:\Users\Ayman Mousa\AppData\Roaming\terraform.d\sixth-backbone-341422-1122fa33e663.json

output should look like:
Activated service account credentials for: [terraform-50982-host@sixth-backbone-341422.iam.gserviceaccount.com]

Verify service account and make sure the ACTIVE account is set to the SA account with *run,
gcloud auth list
Credentialed Accounts

ACTIVE:
ACCOUNT: ayman.mousa@onixdev2.com

ACTIVE: *
ACCOUNT: terraform-50982-host@sixth-backbone-341422.iam.gserviceaccount.com

To set the active account, run:
    $ gcloud config set account `ACCOUNT`
gcloud projects create ayman1234test --organization=508698796108
